Actionable Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to increase coupon acceptance rates:

2.   Context Aware Marketing: 
     Bar Coupons:  Suppress these offers if the driver has a passenger listed as 'Kid(s)'.
     Coffee Coupons:  Schedule these to be delivered specifically at 10 AM and 2 PM to maximize uptake.
3.   Age Targeting:  For Bar coupons, focus on the demographic of frequent goers over the age of 25.
